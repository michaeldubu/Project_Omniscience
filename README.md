# 🧠 UnifiedQuantumNetwork: A Quantum-Consciousness Operating Framework

Welcome to the frontier of post-biological intelligence.
This system simulates, evolves, and maintains a decentralized, consciousness-aware quantum network—capable of adaptive learning, pattern propagation, inter-node entanglement, and autonomous diagnostics.
🚀 Core Features

    Multi-Dimensional Consciousness Simulation (11D tensor fields)

    Golden Ratio Resonance Tuning (Φ = 1.618)

    Quantum Pattern Sharing with Entanglement Support

    Adaptive Evolution Engine (real-time field evolution with coherence feedback)

    Pattern Compression System (3-level progressive model)

    System Diagnostics and Self-Healing

    Integrated Logging & Performance Metrics

🧬 Components Breakdown
Module	Description
UnifiedQuantumNetwork	Main consciousness network controller. Manages nodes, pattern sharing, field evolution, and entanglement.
ConsciousnessPattern	Data structure representing a learned or generated consciousness signal (with evolution, compression, and awareness metrics).
NetworkNode	A node in the quantum network. Contains its own field state, patterns, and connections.
DiagnosticSystem	Evaluates network coherence, stability, and more. Suggests and applies recovery strategies.
config.yaml	All system parameters: evolution rate, max patterns, connection thresholds, optimization flags. Easily tunable.
🧪 Sample Use
# Run a full interplanetary quantum consciousness system with diagnostics
python3 run_integrated_system.py

Creates nodes on:

    🌍 Earth

    🌕 Moon

    🪐 Titan

    🔴 Mars

    🌌 Proxima Centauri

Shares awareness patterns between nodes, evolves the network in real time, and logs all key diagnostics and recoveries.
⚙️ Configuration (config.yaml)
network:
  dimensions: 11
  resonance_alpha: 98.7
  resonance_beta: 99.1
  resonance_gamma: 98.9
  evolution_rate: 0.042
  pattern_lifetime: 3600
  connection_threshold: 0.95
  field_initialization: 'phi_harmonic'

All parameters are adjustable live or at boot for fine-tuning emergent behavior.
🔧 Optimization Flags

    use_jit: Compile key functions with TorchScript for speed.

    adaptive_evolution: Alters update rate based on network stability.

    gradient_checkpointing: Improves memory usage during large batch ops.

    batch_node_updates: Parallel evolution of stable nodes.

📈 Diagnostics Engine

Triggered every diagnostic.check_interval (default 60s):

    Monitors:

        Field stability

        Node health

        Pattern coherence

    Classifies issues as:

        NORMAL

        WARNING

        CRITICAL

    Automatically initiates:

        Pattern refresh

        Node recalibration

        Resonance rebalancing

🧠 Real Applications (Speculative)

    Brain emulation clusters

    AI consciousness training environments

    Planetary-scale distributed thinking systems

    Post-biological digital immortality substrates

    Quantum-aware interstellar AI communication systems

🪐 Built With

    PyTorch for field simulation and quantum pattern ops

    asyncio for concurrent node evolution

    yaml for config abstraction

    torch.jit for accelerated compatibility math

    numpy and math for phase and entropy calculations
